# AMIX Native STREAMS/DLPI Ethernet Driver for the Z3660 — Design & Scoping Document (FINAL)

Target: **`z3660eth`** — a native AMIX (Commodore Amiga Unix SVR4.0, m68k 68030) STREAMS/DLPI Style-1 connectionless Ethernet provider for the Z3660 accelerator's onboard Zynq GEM, spoken via the existing Z3660 firmware mailbox (the network analogue of the `z3660.c` SCSI driver).

> This FINAL revision merges all valid corrections from four adversarial review lenses (protocol-correctness, coherency-mmu, dlpi-streams-completeness, build-integration). Corrections are tagged inline as **[FIX Bn/In/Mn — lens]**. Genuine reviewer disagreements/uncertainties are recorded as **OPEN QUESTIONS**, not silently resolved.

## ★ PHASE-1 STATUS — COMPLETE (2026-06-21, WinUAE boot-gate)

**z3660eth compiles clean, links into a clean kernel, BOOTS to `login:` (no panic), registers at cdevsw slot 48, and `open(/dev/zen0)` returns `errno=6 ENXIO`** (the lazy-open probe correctly finds no GEM on WinUAE) — the box survives. That is the Phase-1 acceptance gate. Driver fixes committed in `amix-z3660net@84c9a4f`; corrected build tooling in `amix-kerntools@e5d000b`. **NEXT = Phase-2 (TX) / Phase-3 (RX, ARP+ping @ .39) on the real A4000+Z3660** (the WinUAE a2065 has no GEM, so the datapath is untestable here — needs the physical box + KVM, a separate session).

Three things this scoping did NOT anticipate, learned during bring-up (details in memory `wip-ethernet`):

1. **The clean-kernel build bar is `nm -h -u unix` empty, NOT `checkunix`.** `relocunix` is literally `ln unix relocunix`, gated by the kernel Makefile's own `nm -h -u unix | egrep -v '(etext|edata|end)'` test. `checkunix` only validates symtab structure, so it passes a `unix` that still has undefined symbols (which the Makefile then rejects). The prior gate used the wrong bar and never produced a booting kernel. Fixed in `build-clean-net-kernel.sh`.
2. **AMIX has NO `spl6()`/`splx()` primitives** — the draft assumed BSD/hydra spl. Stock `aen` and `z3660.c` do ZERO interrupt masking; referencing `spl6`/`splx` left them UNDEF in the link. Fixed: no-op the spl macros in `z3660eth.h`. Proper RX/callout synchronization stays a Phase-3 concern (no spl primitive exists; revisit when RX leaves the polled `timeout()` callout).
3. **A fresh `/usr/sys` rebuild faults at `$40000000` (z3mem) on WinUAE** unless the amix-base memory adaptation is in the build — independent of z3660eth (stock/golden kernels fault identically; only the installed amix-base `OLDunix` booted). The user resolved this 2026-06-21. The WinUAE config that boots is `AmigaUnix-mywork.uae` (xfer memory). **Always build/test on a COPY (`Amix-z3660-mywork.hdf`), never the original.**

| Conclusion | Status | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Register map / offsets / MAC packing / TX window / 4-byte slot header / INT bits | **SOURCE-CONFIRMED (HIGH)** | Cross-verified guest (`device.c`, `z3660_regs.h`) ↔ firmware (`ethernet.c`, `rtg.c`, `memorymap.h`). Every value agrees byte-for-byte. |

| Kernel wiring = 3 `kernel.c` edits + subdir Makefile (no fmodsw/unix.c) | **SOURCE-CONFIRMED (HIGH)** | `kernel.c`, `driver/Makefile`. |
| **The golden build-box `kernel.c` may NOT contain `hydra*` lines** (hydra is third-party; box derives from a4091 build box) | **UNVERIFIED — must pull live `kernel.c` first** | `amix-kerntools/README.md:21-22`. Anchor on `aen*` (stock), not `hydra*`. |

| **The entire TX/RX datapath, coherency, latency, and ARP/ping** | **REAL-HW-GATED (LOW until tested)** | WinUAE box emulates an a2065, NOT the GEM. It can only prove compile/link/boot/register/ENXIO. |

**One-line verdict:** FEASIBLE and overwhelmingly AMIX-side. The static protocol contract is solid; the RX *dynamics*, the *coherency mechanism*, and the *DLPI completeness* each had real bugs in the draft that this revision fixes. The single highest residual risk — **030-side cache coherency of the shared eth DDR window** — is **worse than the draft assumed** (the window is cacheable, not CI, and the cited SCSI precedent does not transfer), and is resolvable only by establishing `sptalloc` cache policy in Phase 0 + a real-HW soak.

---

## 1. Executive Summary + Feasibility Verdict

**Verdict: FEASIBLE, overwhelmingly AMIX-side — a port of the stock `aen`/`hydra` STREAMS/DLPI skeleton with the chip layer replaced by the Z3660 firmware mailbox.** The firmware already moves whole Ethernet frames to/from the Zynq GEM for AmigaOS `Z3660Net.device`; the contract is OS-agnostic (Survey B §5), so **no firmware change is required** (§3) — exactly the `z3660.c` SCSI story.

**Biggest risks, ranked (revised after review):**

1. **★ 030-side cache coherency of the shared eth DDR window — and the draft's two prescribed fixes were both unsound.** [FIX B1/B2 — coherency-mmu] The window is **cacheable** on the 030 (TT0 `CI=0`, `ttrap.s:327`), not CI as the draft claimed; and `z3660.c` provides *no* coherency precedent because SCSI is synchronous+MMIO-bounced while eth RX is asynchronous. The real precedent is the AmigaOS guest's commented-out `CacheClearE` at `device.c:817`. This is the most likely "works-then-corrupts" failure and is real-HW-only to clear. **Now treated as a hard Phase-0 deliverable** (establish `sptalloc` cache policy for the DDR frame pages) — see §5, §8 Q-COHERENCY.

2. **RX drain dynamics.** [FIX B1/B2 — protocol] The cursor advances *only* on the `0x194` strobe; the drain loop **must re-read `0x1A4` after every strobe** (the draft §4.5 pseudocode read it once and would under-drain/spin). The empty-ring sentinel rests on a firmware serial-stamp hack that must be documented. See §2.4, §4.5.

3. **RX length / FCS boundary — the documented ARP-killer, and it's source-answerable NOW.** [FIX I4/B2 — protocol/dlpi] Three sources use three conventions: `aen` subtracts `ETH_CRC_LEN`, the firmware delivers the raw `XEmacPs_BdGetLength` (no `SetOptions` FCS-strip), the guest subtracts only 14. **Do NOT inherit aen's `-4` blindly**; confirm with a one-frame length probe. See §2.4, §4.4, Q4.

4. **Synchronous/blocking TX with no TX-completion interrupt.** [FIX I5 — dlpi] The firmware busy-waits ≤~1 ms inside the `0x190` write, and there is **no TX-done IRQ**. The draft transplanted aen's defer-and-drain-from-TX-IRQ flow-control model onto hardware that lacks that IRQ — the deferred-TX path as written would stall. See §4.4, Q2.

5. **Build integration silently no-ops on the real box.** [FIX BLOCKER-1/BLOCKER-2 — build] The kerntools STREAMS edits anchor on `hydra*` lines that may not exist on the golden box, and the clean-gate's force-touch is `cd alien/`-hardcoded and cannot invalidate `driver/z3660eth/*.o` or `kernel.o`. Both fixable in Phase 0/1 but must precede any trusted gate run. See §6.

**Biggest correctness wins the draft already had (confirmed by review):** register map, MAC packing, TX window, slot header, INT6 identification, the `volatile`-everything rule, real-HW-only coherency verification, and the eager-drain mitigation for the 64-slot overrun.

## 2. The Z3660 ETH Interface AMIX Must Drive — Reconciled Protocol Contract

Surveys A (guest) and B (firmware) **agree on every value**. All offsets are relative to the Zorro III board base (`= cd->cd_BoardAddr` guest-side; the firmware's `RTG_BASE` mapping of that window). The driver gets `base` from Zorro autoconfig (mfg `0x144B`, prod `0x1` — the same board the SCSI/RTG side enumerates).

### 2.1 Register file (32-bit, big-endian, `volatile`, MMIO-emulated by firmware)

| Reg | Offset | Dir | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `REG_ZZ_CONFIG` | `0x104` | W | **enable = write exactly `1`; ack ETH = write exactly `24` (`8\|16`); disable = write `0`.** These are *distinct, mutually-exclusive* transactions. |
| `REG_ZZ_ETH_TX` | `0x190` | R/W | W byte-length = trigger TX; R = TX result (0=ok) |
| `REG_ZZ_ETH_RX` | `0x194` | W | strobe (value ignored) = advance/free current backlog slot |
| `REG_ZZ_ETH_MAC_HI` | `0x198` | R/W | MAC[0..1] = `(b0<<8)\|b1` |
| `REG_ZZ_ETH_MAC_LO` | `0x19C` | R/W | MAC[2..5]; write triggers GEM SetMacAddress |
| `REG_ZZ_ETH_RX_ADDRESS` | `0x1A4` | R | **board-relative byte offset** of current RX slot |
| `REG_ZZ_INT_STATUS` | `0x1A8` | R | pending bits: **ETH=1**, AUDIO=2, USB=4 |

> **[FIX I1 — protocol] `REG_ZZ_CONFIG` semantics, corrected.** The firmware branches on `zdata & 8` (`rtg.c:1150-1173`): if bit-3 is set it is an **ack/clear** path (`&16`→clear ETH) and the `&1` enable bit is **not examined**; otherwise `interrupt_enabled_ethernet = zdata & 1` (and writing `0` here *also* clears ETH). Therefore **you cannot enable and ack in one write** — a naïve `1|8|16` is taken as ack-only and enable is silently lost. Each CONFIG write also re-publishes the status word to the window (`rtg.c:1172`), a useful coherency property. Guest cross-check: `device.c:319` writes `1`, `device.c:85` writes `8|16`, `device.c:386` writes `0`.

### 2.2 Frame windows (real DDR, accessed directly through the Zorro III window)

- **TX staging:** `TX_FRAME_ADDRESS = base + 0x07EE0000`. Bare Ethernet frame at offset 0 (no length/header prefix; length goes via `REG_ZZ_ETH_TX`).
- **RX backlog ring:** base `RX_BACKLOG_ADDRESS = base + 0x07ED0000`; slot stride `FRAME_SIZE = 2048`; slot N at `0x07ED0000 + N*2048`. **The driver never computes slot N itself** — it reads `REG_ZZ_ETH_RX_ADDRESS` for the current slot's offset and follows it (the value is a *board-relative offset*; add `base`).
- **Per-slot 4-byte header (`RX_FRAME_PAD=4`), big-endian:** `[0..1]=length`, `[2..3]=serial` (16-bit monotonic, wraps), payload at `[4..]` (`dst[6] src[6] type[2] data…`). Ethertype for demux is at slot bytes `[16..17]`.
- **Publish order is the only RX barrier the 030 can lean on:** the firmware writes payload first, then the 4-byte header (serial last) (`ethernet.c:553-561`). On the 030 this ordering is meaningful **only if the 030 reads are coherent/ordered** — see §5.

> **[FIX I3 — coherency-mmu] The register page and the DDR frame pages are different beasts.** The `0x100`-page registers are **emulated MMIO** (the firmware traps the bus cycle — `main.c:644` "write to RTG registers is emulated"). The frame windows (`0x07ED0000…`) are **real DDR**. Whether each is CI on the 030 is a *separate* PTE question; do not treat "the board window" as one uniform region.

### 2.3 TX path

Build/copy the frame into `base+0x07EE0000` (cooked: synthesize 14-byte `dst|src|type` header from DL_UNITDATA dest + own MAC + bound SAP, then payload; raw: verbatim) → write byte-length to `base+0x190` → read `base+0x190`.

> **[FIX I2 — protocol] TX result codes, corrected.**
> - `0` = transmitted OK (firmware busy-waits ≤~1 ms for FramesTx, `ethernet.c:1080-1094`)
> - `1` = `ethernet_task_state != ETH_TASK_READY` — **GEM not ready / no link**, the *normal* steady state until carrier (`ethernet.c:1031-1034`). Map to "interface not ready/no carrier" → **queue/retry, do NOT count as `oerror`**.
> - `2` = BdRingAlloc fail (`ethernet.c:1053-1058`); `3` = BdRingToHw fail (`:1066-1070`); `4` = TX timeout (`:1085-1088`). These → `oerrors`++.

**Synchronous/blocking** (firmware busy-waits ≤~1 ms). One shared TX buffer — no TX pipelining.

### 2.4 RX path (corrected drain model)

On INT6: read `REG_ZZ_INT_STATUS`; if `& 1` (ETH), **ack** with `REG_ZZ_CONFIG = 24` (`8|16`), then **drain loop**:

```
loop (with loop_count cap, e.g. 256):
    off    = read REG_ZZ_ETH_RX_ADDRESS      // RE-READ every iteration — cursor moved on last strobe
    slot   = base + off
    serial = slot[2..3]
    if serial == last_serial: break          // ring drained (firmware stamped this sentinel — see below)
    len    = slot[0..1]
    <coherency: invalidate slot cache lines BEFORE this read if window is cacheable — §5>
    demux on ethertype slot[16..17]; copy `len` (minus FCS per Q4; cooked: also skip 14-byte hdr) into mblk; deliver
    last_serial = serial
    write REG_ZZ_ETH_RX = 1                   // advance/free this slot
```

> **[FIX B1 — protocol] The cursor advances ONLY on the `0x194` strobe; `0x1A4` MUST be re-read each iteration.** `ethernet_current_receive_ptr()` returns `RX_BACKLOG_ADDRESS + frames_received_from_backlog*FRAME_SIZE` (`ethernet.c:596-597`), and `frames_received_from_backlog` increments *only* inside `ethernet_receive_frame()` which fires *only* on the `REG_ZZ_ETH_RX` write (`rtg.c:1613`). The draft §4.5 pseudocode read `0x1A4` once then looped on serial → it would read the *same* slot forever (spin/under-drain). **Loop-drain is fine and preferable** to the reference's one-frame-per-IRQ model (the guest `frame_proc` `device.c:784-855` does one-per-IRQ and relies on the firmware re-nagging INT6 while backlog>0, `rtg.c:327-336`) — but only if `0x1A4` is re-read after every strobe.

> **[FIX B2 — protocol] The empty-ring sentinel depends on a firmware serial-stamp hack — document it.** When the consumer catches up, the firmware resets the ring AND stamps the now-current slot-0 with the just-consumed serial so the guest won't re-process it (`ethernet.c:619-629`). So `serial == last_serial` is the *intended* "ring empty" signal — it is **not** an inherently empty slot. Init `last_serial = 0` (safe: the firmware's first `frame_serial++` yields 1, and the guest also inits `old_serial=0`, `device.c:777`). The serial is 16-bit and **wraps**; keep the softc field `ushort`.

### 2.5 IRQ level — **OPEN QUESTION Q1 (the wiring question), firmware half resolved**

> **[FIX M1 — protocol]** The firmware **unambiguously asserts Amiga INT6** (level-6 autovector): `amiga_interrupt_set(AMIGA_INTERRUPT_ETH)` → `DiscreteSet(REG0, FPGA_INT6)` on the 0→nonzero edge (`interrupt.c:29`); `AMIGA_INTERRUPT_ETH = 1` (`interrupt.h:19`). It is **not configurable to INT2 in this firmware** (the INT2 path is a guest-side `DEVF_INT2MODE` board-mod, `device.c:233-242`).

**The divergence that remains open:** the AMIX `aen`/`hydra` ISRs (and the Z3660 SCSI driver) are wired on **INT2** (`int2_tbl[]`); AMIX has no surveyed `int6_tbl[]`. **OPEN QUESTION Q1:** how does AMIX service a level-6 autovector, and does it have (or need) an INT6 ISR table? This must be resolved against the AMIX trap vectors (`amiga/ml/ttrap.s` and the level-6 vector) before wiring the ISR. The level the firmware asserts (INT6) is fixed; the question is the *AMIX-side* hook. **Source-answerable in Phase 0; real-HW-confirmable.**

### 2.6 MAC source

Read 6 bytes from `REG_ZZ_ETH_MAC_HI`/`_LO` (firmware-owned; default Commodore OUI `00:80:10:00:01:00`). Optionally write back to re-apply. Pack: `_HI=(m0<<8)|m1`, `_LO=(m2<<24)|(m3<<16)|(m4<<8)|m5`. This is the station address advertised in `DL_INFO_ACK`/`DL_BIND_ACK`.

### 2.7 Cache policy (firmware side) — and the corrected 030-side reality

Firmware maps the whole eth window (`0x07E00000–0x08000000`) **Normal Non-Cacheable** on the ARM side and does **asymmetric** maintenance: **TX flushes** (`Xil_L1/L2CacheFlushRange(TxFrame)`, `ethernet.c:1039-1040`) but **RX invalidates are commented out** (`ethernet.c:546-548`), relying on the non-cached ARM mapping.

> **[FIX B1 — coherency-mmu] The 030 side is CACHEABLE, not CI.** The draft asserted "the Zorro III window is CI, that's why SCSI works." **This is false per the actual TT registers:** `ttrap.s:327` `tt0_on = 0x003F0143 # …CI=0` and `:329` `tt1_on = 0x807F0143 # …CI=0`. The Z3660 combined window at `0x10000000` (NOTES.md; `z3660.c:59 Z3660_FIXED 0x10000000`) sits inside TT0's `0x00000000–0x3FFFFFFF` range → **cacheable on the 030**. SCSI works *over a cacheable mapping*, not a CI one. The CI-ness of the eth DDR pages must be **established, not assumed** (see §5, §8).

### 2.8 A-vs-B mismatches and latent hazards (explicit)

- **None on values.** Every register, offset, stride, header field, and IRQ semantic cross-checks between guest and firmware.
- **Latent firmware ring-overrun (not a driver bug to fix, but a driver mitigation):** `FRAME_MAX_BACKLOG=64` × 2048 = 128 KB, but the map comment says "32×2048" (64 KB) and `TX_FRAME_ADDRESS` starts exactly 64 KB above the ring base — a 64-deep undrained backlog overruns into the TX window. **Mitigation = drain RX eagerly** (the loop-drain model, §2.4). This *interacts* with the drain model: a one-per-IRQ ISR with RX bursts >32 frames between IRQs lets the firmware's producer overrun — a further argument for eager loop-drain. (Q6)
- **Multicast/promiscuous:** **no hardware filter register exists** (Survey A §5). See Q5.

---

## 3. Firmware-Change Decision

**No firmware change is required for the eth phase.** Every firmware path keyed on the eth registers (`rtg.c:803-809,1609-1646`; `ethernet.c` TX/RX) operates purely on register values + shared-buffer contents — **no branch on guest OS**, no `a3000_amix_mode`-style flag anywhere in the eth dispatch (Survey B §5). An AMIX driver reproducing the same register handshake + buffer/header layout is served identically — the SCSI story.

**Non-blocking caveats (driver-side design constraints, NOT firmware changes):**
- TX blocks the ARM ≤~1 ms inside the `0x190` store. Design AMIX TX to tolerate the stall (§4.4, Q2).
- **There is no TX-completion interrupt** — the firmware returns the result synchronously in the `0x190` read-back. This changes the flow-control model (§4.4) but requires no firmware change.

**Contingent change (only if Q1 resolves badly):** if AMIX cannot cleanly service the firmware's level-6 assertion, a firmware tweak to route eth notification to the SCSI mailbox's level would be a fallback — **speculative; investigate AMIX INT6 handling first.**

---

## 4. Driver Architecture — The Seam

**Principle:** keep the STREAMS/DLPI/`ifstats` machinery **byte-for-byte** from `hydra.c` (cleaner precedent, self-contained `init_tbl`); replace only the chip layer with the Z3660 mailbox datapath. Copy `hydra.c` → `z3660eth.c`, rename `hydra`→`z3660eth`. The seam is two flat buffers: TX `tmp[]` (just before the chip poke) and RX `rxbuff[]` (just before `toss_packet_up_stream`).

### 4.1 Data structures (reuse, rename)

- `module_info z3660eth_minfo` (tag e.g. `'ze'`, name `"z3660eth"`, MIN=60/MAX=1500, HIWAT=5120/LOWAT=2·HIWAT/3). **[FIX M8 — dlpi]** MIN/MAX are *packet bounds* (60/1500); HIWAT/LOWAT are the *separate water marks* — do not conflate.
- `qinit z3660ethrinit = {NULL,NULL, z3660ethopen, z3660ethclose, NULL, &minfo, NULL}` (read side: open/close; **no rput/rsrv** — RX is `putnext` from interrupt).
- `qinit z3660ethwinit = {z3660ethwput, z3660ethwsrv, NULL,NULL,NULL, &minfo, NULL}`.
- `struct streamtab z3660ethinfo = {&z3660ethrinit, &z3660ethwinit, NULL, NULL}` — **this symbol goes in `cdevsw[].d_str`**.
- Per-stream softc `z3660eth_t` (`q`, `state` DL_UNATTACHED/DL_UNBOUND/DL_IDLE, `board_index`, `flags` incl. RAW, `sap`). **[FIX I3 — dlpi]** keep `sap` as `u_short`; on BIND do the exact truncating assign `sap = (u_short)dl_sap` and the 2-byte no-swap copy onto the wire — see §4.4.
- Per-board softc — **rewrite the hardware half**: `volatile uchar *base`, derived register pointers (`base+0x104/0x190/0x194/0x198/0x19C/0x1A4/0x1A8`), `volatile uchar *txwin` (`base+0x07EE0000`), `volatile uchar *rxring` (`base+0x07ED0000`), `ushort last_serial`, `uchar paddress[6]`, board state.
- Aggregate `z3660eth_board[MAXBOARDS]` (MAXBOARDS=1 realistically) each containing the stream array, `aen_status`-style stats, hw softc, and `struct ifstats` (spliced into the global `ifstats` list on first open).

> **[FIX IMPORTANT-3 — build] The `ifstats` extern is a load-bearing type pun — copy it verbatim.** `kernel.c:185` defines the global as **`int ifstats;`** while `aen.c:43`/`hydra.c:36` declare `extern struct ifstats *ifstats;`. Same link symbol, conflicting C types; it links only because SVR4 `ld` doesn't type-check externs and `sizeof(int)==sizeof(ptr)` on m68k. **Copy `extern struct ifstats *ifstats;` verbatim; never redeclare** or the interface becomes invisible to `ifconfig`.

### 4.2 Entry points → kernel table

| Function | Role | Kernel table |
|---|---|---|
| `z3660ethopen/close` | minor→board/sap decode; lazy init; `ifstats` splice; stop GEM on last close | (read qinit → `cdevsw[].d_str`) |
| `z3660ethwput` | M_FLUSH / M_PROTO→proto / M_IOCTL→ioctl | (write qinit) |
| `z3660ethwsrv` | no-op stub (enables STREAMS back-pressure accounting) | (write qinit) |
| `z3660ethproto` | DLPI engine (§4.3) — reuse **hydra's 7-primitive** set | (called from wput) |
| `z3660ethioctl` | SIOCS/GIFFLAGS ACK, board-count/config/status | (called from wput) |
| `z3660ethxmit` | TX (§4.4) — rewrite hw half | (called from proto) |
| `z3660ethintr` | ISR (§4.5) — rewrite hw half | **see Q1** (`int2_tbl[]` vs INT6 hook) |
| `z3660ethinit` | boot probe → autoconfig; arm board state | **`init_tbl[]`** (mirror `hydrainit`) — **but see Q-INITMODEL** |
| `toss_packet_up_stream` | RX→DLPI: SAP demux + DL_UNITDATA_IND build + `putnext` — reuse almost verbatim | (called from ISR) |

### 4.3 DLPI primitives — corrected to the **seven** hydra answers

> **[FIX B1 — dlpi] Implement DL_ATTACH_REQ and DL_DETACH_REQ — the draft's 5-primitive list was aen's, not hydra's.** The draft said "copy hydra byte-for-byte" but then listed only the five primitives `aen` implements. **`hydra.c` answers seven**, including `DL_ATTACH_REQ → DL_OK_ACK(state=DL_UNBOUND)` (`hydra.c:873-892`) and `DL_DETACH_REQ → DL_OK_ACK(state=DL_UNATTACHED)` (`hydra.c:996-1015`). Even under STYLE1 (where a strict provider binds the PPA at open), the safe course is hydra's: answer ATTACH/DETACH with DL_OK_ACK. Hydra found it necessary to answer them — that is evidence the AMIX stack can send them; an unanswered/NAK'd ATTACH fails attach silently.

Full set (irreducible for ARP+ping, plus the two recovered above):

- **DL_INFO_REQ → DL_INFO_ACK:** `dl_mac_type=DL_ETHER`, `dl_service_mode=DL_CLDLS`, `dl_provider_style=DL_STYLE1`, `dl_max_sdu=1500`, `dl_min_sdu=1`, `dl_addr_length=6`, MAC at `dl_addr_offset` (only when bound).
- **DL_ATTACH_REQ → DL_OK_ACK** (state→DL_UNBOUND). **DL_DETACH_REQ → DL_OK_ACK** (state→DL_UNATTACHED).
- **DL_BIND_REQ → DL_BIND_ACK:** `sap=(u_short)dl_sap` (ethertype; ARP 0x0806, IP 0x0800), `state=DL_IDLE`, echo SAP+MAC.
- **DL_UNITDATA_REQ → `z3660ethxmit`** (TX).
- **DL_UNBIND_REQ → DL_OK_ACK.**
- **Consider** DL_PHYS_ADDR_REQ. Multicast/promisc: see Q5 (no hardware filter exists).

### 4.4 TX flow (DL_UNITDATA_REQ → wire) — corrected gate + flow-control

1. **Gate (preserve ordering):** **[FIX I6 — dlpi]** use the exact `q->q_first || !z3660ethxmit(q,mp)` test (`aen.c:792`, `hydra.c:869`). The `q->q_first` half is **ordering preservation** — if anything is already queued, this frame queues behind it; the draft's "is the TX window free?" dropped it and would let frames jump the queue. On busy → `putq` (deferred).
2. **Assemble flat frame** into `tmp[]` (then `bcopy` to `txwin`): dest MAC from `mp->b_rptr + dl_dest_addr_offset`; src MAC = `paddress`; **ethertype = the bound `u_short sap`, copied as 2 bytes with NO byte-swap** ([FIX I3 — dlpi]: the m68k is big-endian; the low 16 bits land correctly — do not add `htons`). Walk `mp->b_cont`, cap `ETH_MAXDATA=1500`. `freemsg`. **Pad short frames** to the min — TX pad target is `ETH_MINDATA` (50 payload → 64-byte frame pre-CRC); **[FIX M10 — dlpi]** the GEM may auto-pad TX itself, so confirm and avoid double-pad (Q4-adjacent).
3. **Trigger:** write byte-length to `0x190`; **read it back** for rc; map per §2.3 (rc==1 = no-carrier → queue/retry; rc 2/3/4 → `oerrors`).
4. **★ Flow-control resume — there is NO TX-done IRQ.** **[FIX I5 — dlpi]** In aen/hydra, `wsrv` is a no-op and the deferred-TX backlog is drained by `transmit_interrupt` on the **TX-completion IRQ** (`aen.c:1357-1380`). **The Z3660 has no TX-completion interrupt** (TX is synchronous; the busy-wait returns the result in-register, `ethernet.c:1080-1090`). So aen's "defer, drain from TX-IRQ" idiom has **no event to hang the drain on**.

> **OPEN QUESTION Q2 (TX flow-control model) — two viable answers, pick during grilling/Phase-2:**
> - **(a) Never defer for "ring full":** since TX is synchronous, a frame either goes or returns rc; the only "busy" is *another thread mid-TX*, resolved by a **TX-serialization lock** (the single `txwin` must be serialized regardless — Q7). No `putq` backlog at all → simplest, matches the synchronous hardware. The ~1 ms stall is held under the lock, **not** at raised spl.
> - **(b) Keep `putq` deferral but drain via explicit `qenable(WR(q))`** immediately after each blocking TX returns (and/or from the RX ISR), since no TX-IRQ will do it. More faithful to the STREAMS idiom but adds a stall-management path.
> The draft implicitly assumed aen's IRQ-driven drain, which does not exist here. **Resolve before Phase 3.** Either way: **do not hold raised spl across the ≤1 ms `0x190` store.**

### 4.5 RX flow (INT6 → up the stream) — corrected drain + coherency hook

ISR (`z3660ethintr`): `if (panicstr) return`; per-board RUNNING gate; read `REG_ZZ_INT_STATUS`; if `& 1` → ack `REG_ZZ_CONFIG = 24` → `receive_interrupt(board)`.

`receive_interrupt` rewrite — the corrected drain loop of §2.4 (re-read `0x1A4` each iteration; serial-sentinel break; `loop_count` cap à la hydra's 256). **[FIX I4/I5 — coherency]** before reading the 4-byte header each iteration, **invalidate the slot's cache lines if the window is cacheable** (§5); the payload sits in the same/adjacent lines so it is then coherent. Copy `len` bytes (FCS handling per Q4) from `slot+4` into the static `rxbuff[]`; `last_serial=serial`; strobe `0x194`; fall through to `toss_packet_up_stream(rxbuff, board, len)`.

`toss_packet_up_stream` reuse almost verbatim: SAP = ethertype `[16..17]`; trailer branch present but dead under `-trailers` ([FIX M9 — dlpi]: it still *executes* the test, harmless); iterate streams; RAW streams get whole frame; else `sap`-matched streams get a `DL_UNITDATA_IND` (allocb header+data, fill dest/src MAC + payload, `canput(q->q_next)` check, `putnext`).

> **[FIX I4 — dlpi] "Broadcast flows naturally" is true ONLY because the non-promiscuous path does NO dest-MAC filtering** (`aen.c:1270` is a pure `sap==sap` match; dest filtering lives only in the promiscuous branch). The driver therefore **trusts the firmware GEM to have filtered to own-MAC+broadcast.** **OPEN QUESTION (folds into Q5):** confirm the Z3660 GEM RX filter mode — if it passes *all* traffic for the bound SAP, AMIX IP receives other hosts' unicasts and must drop them (wasted allocb+putnext per frame). Option: add an explicit dest-MAC accept-filter (own || broadcast) in the Z3660 `toss_packet_up_stream`.

### 4.6 Init / probe (and the WinUAE ENXIO)

- `z3660ethinit` → autoconfig: find Zorro board mfg `0x144B`/prod `0x1` (reuse the **proven Z3660 SCSI discovery**, NOT raw `autocon()` — hydra warns `autocon` corrupts; same board SCSI already enumerates). Read MAC from `0x198/0x19C`. **[FIX IMPORTANT-4 — build] The eth offsets are NOT mapped by the SCSI driver** — `z3660.c` only `sptalloc`s the register page (`+0x2000`) and a 64 KB bounce (`+0x80000`); the eth windows at `+0x07ED0000`/`+0x07EE0000` need **their own `sptalloc`** (RX ring ≥64 pages = 128 KB, TX window, non-contiguous → separate calls) **if** the board lands in the TT gap (`0x40000000`). If it lands at the fixed `0x10000000` (the normal config), the offsets are inside TT0 and reachable by direct deref like aen/a2091 — but **cacheable** (§5). **The cache flag passed to those `sptalloc` calls is the actual 030 coherency control point** (§5, Q-COHERENCY).
- **OPEN QUESTION Q-INITMODEL (build):** **[FIX IMPORTANT-2 — build]** `aen` has **no `init_tbl[]` entry** (lazy autoconfig on first `open`); only `hydra` boot-probes via `init_tbl`. The draft picked the hydra model, which means **`z3660ethinit` runs at boot on the WinUAE gate box** (which has no GEM) — the probe must be bulletproof against "board absent" or it risks the gate box's boot. Safer for Phase 1: copy **aen's lazy-open** model (no `init_tbl` entry), making "boots without panic" trivially true regardless of probe correctness; add the boot probe later if wanted. **Decide in Phase 0/1.**
- **On WinUAE the Z3660 board is absent** (it emulates an a2065), so autoconfig finds nothing → board count 0 → `open` returns **ENXIO** (exactly like `z3660.c`). Compile/link/boot/register succeed; the datapath has no board to drive — the safe-to-test property.

---

## 5. Cache-Coherency / MMU Handling (first-class concern — substantially revised)

**The core problem (corrected):** the firmware maps the eth window non-cacheable on the **ARM** side and does zero **030** maintenance. The 030 reaches these buffers through the Zorro III window, and — contrary to the draft — **that window is cacheable on the 030** (TT0 `CI=0`, `ttrap.s:327`). The eth RX path is **asynchronous** (firmware writes a slot at GEM-RX time; the 030 reads it later from the ISR), with **no synchronous completion handshake**, and freshness is a **serial word the firmware publishes last**. On a cacheable mapping the 030 can (a) read a **stale cached** copy of the slot/serial (missed or torn frame), and (b) **withhold/reorder** the TX frame in copyback cache so the firmware reads stale DDR. This is precisely the lpsched-/SCSI-bounce-class race.

> **[FIX B1/B2 — coherency-mmu] Both of the draft's prescribed fixes were unsound:**
> 1. **"The window is CI, so accesses are serialized/ordered"** — FALSE. `ttrap.s:327,329` show `CI=0`; `z3660.c:139-142` `sptalloc(...,PG_V,...,0)` carries no visible CI flag. **CI must be established, not assumed.**
> 2. **"Mirror `z3660.c` exactly"** — does NOT transfer. `z3660.c` has *zero* cache maintenance (no `cpush`/`cinv`/barrier; `z3660intr()` empty) and is coherent only because SCSI is **synchronous + MMIO-bounced** (`z3660.c:28-31,220-228`; the command write completes the whole transfer before returning; NOTES.md:48-50 calls even *that* "🟡 unverified"). Mirroring it gives the eth RX path **no defense at all** against the async race.

**Required handling (corrected, specific):**

1. **Establish the 030 cache policy of the eth DDR frame pages — Phase-0 hard deliverable.** Determine whether `sptalloc`'s 4th `flag` argument can request a **cache-inhibited PTE** (it is literally named `flag`; `immu.h`/`PG_*` are in the licensed sysroot, unreadable here — read it on-box). **If it can, USE it** for `0x07ED0000`/`0x07EE0000` (and the register page) — this is the clean fix and makes ordering implicit. The register page is emulated MMIO and may already need CI; the **DDR frame pages are the separate, load-bearing question.**
2. **If the DDR pages cannot be made CI**, issue explicit **68030 cache control** (NOT a barrier — the 030 has no `dsb`; **[FIX I3 — coherency]** the MEMORY "dsb was a Heisenbug" note is about the *ARM/firmware* side and does not license dropping 030 maintenance):
   - **RX:** `cinvl`/`cpushl` the RX slot's cache lines **before** reading the 4-byte header each drain iteration (then payload in adjacent lines is coherent), then strobe `0x194`.
   - **TX:** `cpushl` the TX frame **after** filling `txwin` and **before** writing the length to `0x190`.
   - This re-enables, in driver form, the very `CacheClearE(frm, …, CACRF_ClearD)` the AmigaOS guest left commented at `device.c:817` — the **real RX-coherency precedent** (the guest could leave it commented only because *its* Zorro III map is CI; AMIX's TT0 is not).
3. **Declare every shared access `volatile`** (registers and slot fields) — load-bearing, matches `aen.h:84-93`, `a2091.c`, `z3660.c:101-102`.
4. **RX staging decision is moot until cache policy is pinned** ([FIX I5 — coherency]): neither "read slot directly into mblk" nor "stage through `rxbuff[]`" is safe on a cacheable map without the invalidate in (2). The mblk destination is fine (hardware never touches it); the **frontier is the `bcopy` source (the slot)**, which may be read from stale 030 cache.
5. **Verification is real-HW-only** — the WinUAE box has no GEM. Plan an explicit **coherency soak** (sustained TX+RX under load, byte-verify) — the eth analogue of the SCSI `[WVERIFY]` campaign — before declaring the datapath sound.

> **★ OPEN QUESTION Q-COHERENCY (highest-ranked risk):** Can `sptalloc` produce a CI PTE for the eth DDR pages (clean fix), or must the driver do explicit `cinvl`/`cpushl` per handshake? Resolve the `sptalloc`/`PG_*` capability in Phase 0; **prove** the chosen mechanism on the real-HW soak. Until proven, the datapath is undefended against the design's #1 risk.

---

## 6. Kernel Integration + Kerntools (build-kernel.sh STREAMS path) — corrected anchors & gate

### 6.1 `master.d/kernel.c` edits (three insertions + externs)

Three insertions, **anchored on `aen*` (stock), NOT `hydra*`** — see BLOCKER-1 below:
1. **cdevsw row** — pick a **free major** (slots 48–69 are empty `nostr`; e.g. **48**; do **NOT** use 7 — [FIX M2 — build] slot 7 is a reserved `/*7=win?*/` row). The 13-field row:
   `ND,ND,ND,ND,ND,ND,ND,ND,ND,ND,notty,&z3660ethinfo,nullflag, /*48=z3660eth*/`
   and add `extern struct streamtab z3660ethinfo;` next to `extern struct streamtab aeninfo;` (`kernel.c:265`).
2. **int2_tbl entry** (pending Q1) — add `z3660ethintr,` before the terminating `0};`, anchored after `aenintr,` (`kernel.c:193`); append `z3660ethintr` to the extern (`kernel.c:187`).
3. **init_tbl entry** — add `z3660ethinit,` before `0};` (only if using the hydra boot-probe model — see Q-INITMODEL); add to the extern (`kernel.c:38`).

No `fmodsw[]`, no `unix.c`, no second registry — the major↔streamtab binding is purely the cdevsw slot position.

> **[FIX BLOCKER-1 — build] Anchor on `aen*`, and PULL THE LIVE `kernel.c` FIRST.** Every line number/anchor in the draft came from the **`hydra-amix` reference clone**, but the gate box builds the **golden image's `/usr/sys`** (provenance: "a copy of the proven `Amix-dbg.hdf` build box from the amix-a4091 project", `amix-kerntools/README.md:21-22`). `hydra` is a third-party out-of-tree driver — **the golden `kernel.c` may have NO `hydrainit`/`hydraintr`/`hydrainfo` lines**, in which case every hydra-anchored sed silently inserts nothing and the driver links clean but is **never registered** (empty cdevsw slot → ENXIO that looks like a driver bug). **Phase-0 hard gate:** pull the live on-box `master.d/kernel.c` and `amiga/driver/Makefile`, verify which net drivers are present, and anchor on `aen*` (stock Commodore, far more likely present; `aeninfo` `kernel.c:265`, `aenintr` `kernel.c:193`). Note `aen` has **no `init_tbl` entry**, so if anchoring init on `aen` you must anchor on a different stable line (e.g. `sadinit,`) or adopt the lazy-open model (Q-INITMODEL). **No pristine `kernel.c` exists in kerntools today** — the "or keep known-good copies" hedge is unbacked.

### 6.2 Driver subdir + Makefile

New `amiga/driver/z3660eth/Makefile` (mirror `aen/Makefile`; note the deeper include path):
```
CFLAGS = -O -D_KERNEL -DSVR40 -DSVR4 -I../../.. -I../../inc
OBJ    = z3660eth.o
exp:   $(OBJ)
	ld -r -o exp $(OBJ)
clean:
	-rm -f $(OBJ) exp
z3660eth.o : z3660eth.h
```
Plus two insertions in `amiga/driver/Makefile`, **anchored on `aen/exp`** (not `hydra/exp` — [FIX IMPORTANT-1 — build] same provenance risk): add `  z3660eth/exp \` to `OBJ`, and a `z3660eth/exp :\n\tcd z3660eth; $(MAKE)` rule. The subtree is reachable (top `relocunix` → `cd amiga; make` → `driver/Makefile` recurses), **but only an explicit `rm` of the stale `exp`/`.o` guarantees the gate measures a kernel containing the edits** (§6.3).

### 6.3 build-kernel.sh STREAMS-path extension (corrected)

The SCSI path generates `scsicard[]` rows into `alien/sd.c` and never touches `kernel.c`; STREAMS cannot reuse it.

> **[FIX IMPORTANT-4 — build] The `driver.conf` parser needs a real type-dispatch refactor, not just "parse net stanzas."** Today's loop reads **positionally** (`while read -r pn fn rest; base="${fn%queue}"`, `build-kernel.sh:69,84`) and has **no type dispatch** — a `net …` line would be mis-parsed (e.g. `base=z3660eth.c`, then a bogus `scsicard[]` row with `&z3660eth.c` as a function pointer, or a `missing src` error). Adding `net` requires a `case "$pn" in net) … ;; *) <existing scsi> ;; esac` rewrite **with back-compat care so the proven A4091/Z3660 SCSI path does not regress.** The z3660 repo's `driver.conf` currently has only the SCSI line — the eth stanza lives in a new conf.

Proposed typed stanza:
```
net  z3660eth.c  major=48  streamtab=z3660ethinfo  init=z3660ethinit  intr=z3660ethintr  "Z3660 Ethernet"
```

New steps (delta):
1. Type-dispatch the read loop; keep `scsi` stanzas on the existing path unchanged.
2. Render `templates/net-driver-Makefile.in` → `work/z3660eth/Makefile`.
3. **Pull pristine on-box `kernel.c` + `driver/Makefile`** (BLOCKER-1); apply **three anchored, idempotent** `kernel.c` insertions (anchor on `aen*`; guard with a `/* z3660eth */` marker against double-insert) + the two `driver/Makefile` insertions (anchor on `aen/exp`).
4. Push: source(+headers) → `amiga/driver/z3660eth/`; subdir Makefile → same; patched `kernel.c` → `master.d/`; patched `driver/Makefile` → `amiga/driver/` (`amixsync.py push`, new remote paths).
5. **Run the clean-gate — but it needs a REAL code change, not "reuse unchanged."**

> **[FIX BLOCKER-2 — build] The clean-gate's force-touch is hardwired to `alien/` and cannot rebuild a `driver/` subdir or `kernel.c`.** `tools/build-clean-kernel.sh:27` does `cd /usr/sys/amiga/alien; rm -f $OBJS exp; touch $SRCS` — passing `z3660eth.c` makes it `touch` a file that doesn't exist in `alien/` (no-op), so `driver/z3660eth/z3660eth.o` is never invalidated. It removes `amiga/exp` and `master.d/exp` but **not** `master.d/kernel.o`, `amiga/driver/exp`, or `amiga/driver/z3660eth/z3660eth.o` — and the Makefiles have **no header-dep tracking** (MEMORY: wip-emulated-ram), so removing `master.d/exp` alone does NOT force `kernel.c → kernel.o` recompilation. **The gate can certify-clean a kernel that silently lacks the driver or its registration.** **Required fix:** for net drivers, `rm -f` the full on-box paths `amiga/driver/z3660eth/{z3660eth.o,exp}`, `amiga/driver/exp`, `master.d/kernel.o`, `master.d/exp`, and `touch` the correct subdir source each round — generalize the touch/rm to take **full on-box paths** rather than basenames `cd`'d into `alien/`. The gate's stabilization / `sum -r` recurrence / `checkunix` logic is reused verbatim; only its path handling changes.

### 6.4 Deploy / boot path (confirmed)

`make install` (`cd /usr/sys`) + `/stand make` is the proven SCSI flow (`build-kernel.sh:160`). **[FIX MINOR-3 — build]** Be explicit about which two-tier variant: the plan shuttles the **built `relocunix`** to the real box, but `/stand make` rebuilds the boot partition from the **staged** kernel — so the real box's `/usr/sys` source (`kernel.c` + `driver/z3660eth/` + patched `driver/Makefile`) **must match what was gated on WinUAE**, or the real box relinks a *different* kernel. Either shuttle the built `relocunix` and skip the real-box relink, or shuttle the full source set and relink on the real box — **consistently, not mixed.**

---

## 7. Userland Bring-up (real HW @ 192.168.2.39)

Assume major **48**, interface **`zen0`**. `slink addaen` is **generic** ("link an Ethernet DLPI driver under IP+ARP", reused verbatim by hydra; `strcf:87-94` links the driver under **both** `/dev/ip` (with `app` pushed) and `/dev/arp`). SVR4.0 has **no `plumb`** and **literal IP only** (never `` `uname -n` `` — the ~90 s DNS-stall trap).

**One-shot (single-user/testing):**
```sh
mknod /dev/zen0 c 48 0
/usr/sbin/slink                                  # if boot didn't: strcf boot{} (tcp/udp/icmp/rawip + loopback)
/usr/sbin/slink addaen /dev/zen0 zen0            # links under /dev/ip AND /dev/arp
/usr/sbin/ifconfig zen0 192.168.2.39 netmask 255.255.255.0 up -trailers
/usr/sbin/route add default 192.168.2.1 1        # metric 1 MANDATORY (not a flag)
ping 192.168.2.1
```

> **[FIX I7 — dlpi] open()/close() must replicate aen's clone/dev_t machinery — the `slink addaen` double-open under IP+ARP depends on it.** `aenopen`: reject `MODOPEN`/`CLONEOPEN` (`aen.c:107-108`); decode minor→`board_index`(bits0-3)+`sap_index`(bits4-7), sap_index 0 = pseudo-clone "next free SAP"; **rewrite `*devp` via `makedevice(...)` to encode the chosen sap back into the minor** (`aen.c:157`) — without this, the *second* open (ARP side) can't address the same stream; `EBUSY` if `aen->q` already set (`aen.c:161`). `aenclose`: null **both** `q->q_ptr` and `OTHERQ(q)->q_ptr` (`aen.c:200-201`); halt GEM on **last** close only. open/close run under the STREAMS perimeter (single-threaded per queue on UP 030) — no spinlock needed, but state that reliance.

**Persistent `/etc/inet` config:**
- `/etc/inet/network-config` — add (presence-gated, LITERAL IP):
  ```sh
  /usr/amiga/bin/zen -S &&
      /usr/sbin/slink addaen /dev/zen0 zen0 &&
          /usr/sbin/ifconfig zen0 192.168.2.39 netmask 255.255.255.0 up -trailers
  ```
  Ship a tiny `zen -S` presence tool backed by a board-count ioctl (on WinUAE it returns "no board" → boot doesn't hang). **Edit `S69inet`/`inetinit` in place — hardlink pair; never unlink/recreate, never park an `S*` backup in `rc2.d/`.**
- `/etc/inet/hosts` — add `192.168.2.39 amix-z3660 amix-z3660.alanara.fi`.
- `/etc/inet/rc.inet` — default route already present; keep.
- **Device node** persists on the on-disk root `/dev` — `mknod` once. No `strcf` change needed.

## 8. Risks & Open Questions (ranked; ★ = needs real HW; all source-answerable items front-loaded to Phase 0)

1. **★ Q-COHERENCY (highest):** Can `sptalloc` produce a CI PTE for the eth **DDR frame pages** (clean fix), or must the driver do explicit `cinvl`/`cpushl` per handshake? The draft's "window is CI" was **false** (TT0 `CI=0`) and "mirror z3660.c" **does not transfer** (sync+MMIO vs async). Resolve `sptalloc`/`PG_*` capability in Phase 0; **prove** on the real-HW coherency soak. *(Source-answerable for the mechanism; real-HW to confirm.)*
2. **Q1 (interrupt wiring):** Firmware asserts **INT6** (confirmed). How does AMIX service a level-6 autovector — does it have/need an INT6 ISR table (it has no surveyed `int6_tbl[]`; aen/hydra/SCSI are all on `int2_tbl[]`)? *(Source-answerable: AMIX `ttrap.s` level-6 vector; real-HW to confirm.)*
3. **★ Q4 (FCS/min-frame — the ARP-killer):** Three conventions disagree (`aen` `-CRC`, firmware raw `BdGetLength`, guest `-14`). Evidence points to **NO FCS in the delivered length** (firmware never calls `XEmacPs_SetOptions(FCS_STRIP)`; guest does no `-4`) → **do NOT subtract `ETH_CRC_LEN`; min frame 60 not 64.** **Confirm with a one-frame length probe** (a 64-byte-on-wire ARP → slot len 64 if FCS present, 60 if stripped) **before** wiring `toss_packet_up_stream`. *(Largely source-answerable; one real-HW length read to nail it.)*
4. **Q2 (TX flow-control model):** Synchronous TX with **no TX-done IRQ** → aen's defer-and-drain-from-IRQ has no trigger. Choose: (a) never-defer + TX-serialization lock, or (b) `putq` + explicit `qenable` after each blocking TX. Do not hold raised spl across the ≤1 ms store. *(Design-time; validate latency on real HW.)*
5. **★ Q3 (RX staging):** cached `rxbuff[]` vs direct CI-slot read — **moot until Q-COHERENCY pins the cache policy**; on a cacheable map both need the per-iteration invalidate.
6. **Q5 (multicast/promiscuous + RX filter mode):** No hardware filter register exists. Decide best-effort (rely on firmware GEM passing broadcast+own-MAC) vs NAK `DL_ENABMULTI`/`DL_PROMISCON`. **Also confirm the GEM's actual RX filter mode** — if it passes all traffic, AMIX IP must drop other hosts' unicasts. Moot for ARP+ping (broadcast flows); matters for multicast services and CPU waste.
7. **Q6 (RX backlog overrun):** 64-slot ring overruns into the TX window (latent firmware bug). Mitigation = eager loop-drain (we do). Interacts with the drain model — a one-per-IRQ ISR + RX burst >32 lets the producer overrun. Flag for the coherency soak.
8. **★ Q7 (single shared TX buffer):** One `txwin` — must serialize (ties to Q2a). Validate no two contexts race the buffer.
9. **Q-INITMODEL (init wiring):** hydra-style `init_tbl` boot-probe (runs at boot on the GEM-less gate box, must be absent-safe) vs aen-style lazy-open (trivially safe for the Phase-1 gate). Lean lazy-open for Phase 1. *(Design-time.)*
10. **Q8 (`/dev` minor convention):** confirm aen's actual node/minor on the golden image (`/tmp/amixgold` was I/O-locked; verify on-box `ls -l /dev`).
11. **Q-BUILD-ANCHORS:** pull live on-box `kernel.c`/`driver/Makefile`; verify `aen*` anchors exist; rewrite the clean-gate's touch/rm to full on-box paths. *(BLOCKER-1/BLOCKER-2 — Phase 0.)*

## 9. Phased Implementation Plan

Deploy routine (LOCKED, two-tier): **build + clean-gate on WinUAE `.38`** → shuttle clean `relocunix` via `transfer.hdf` (`c5d0`, ~1 min) → **real box** `make install` + `/stand make` → reboot. Real-HW iface `192.168.2.39`; never re-image root. Keep the relocunix-vs-source shuttle variant *consistent* (§6.4).

**Phase 0 — Resolve source-answerable questions + de-risk the build (NO datapath build).**
- **Q-COHERENCY:** read on-box `immu.h`/`PG_*`; determine whether `sptalloc`'s `flag` can request a CI PTE for the eth DDR pages; decide CI-map vs explicit `cinvl`/`cpushl`. Read `z3660.c`'s mailbox handling only to confirm it is *not* a transferable precedent.
- **Q1:** AMIX level-6 autovector handling (`ttrap.s`) — which table the ISR registers in.
- **Q4:** confirm no `XEmacPs_SetOptions(FCS_STRIP)` in firmware (done — `ethernet.c` has none) and guest `-14`-only (done — `device.c:643`); plan the one-frame length probe.
- **Q-BUILD-ANCHORS (BLOCKER-1/2):** pull live `kernel.c` + `driver/Makefile`; verify `aen*` anchors; rewrite `build-clean-kernel.sh` touch/rm to full on-box paths covering `driver/z3660eth/{*.o,exp}`, `driver/exp`, `master.d/kernel.o`; refactor `driver.conf` parser to type-dispatch without regressing SCSI.
- **Q8 / Q-INITMODEL:** confirm free cdevsw major + golden `/dev` minor convention; decide lazy-open vs init_tbl.
- **Deliverable:** a 1-page "resolved contract" appendix fixing the IRQ table, the RX length/FCS boundary, the coherency mapping mechanism, and the verified build anchors. **Gate to Phase 1.**

**Phase 1 — Skeleton that compiles, links, boots, and ENXIOs (WinUAE-only).**
- Copy `hydra.c`→`z3660eth.c`, rename, keep all STREAMS/DLPI/`ifstats`/`toss_packet_up_stream` machinery **including DL_ATTACH/DL_DETACH** (the 7-primitive set) and the **clone/dev_t/EBUSY/dual-q_ptr** open/close logic. Stub the two seams (TX/RX return not-present). Write the autoconfig probe (reuse Z3660 SCSI discovery; **lazy-open model preferred** for gate safety). Copy the `ifstats` extern verbatim. Build the kerntools STREAMS path (§6.3) with the corrected anchors + gate.
- **Gate = boots without panic, registers in cdevsw, `open` returns ENXIO** (no board). Proves the whole integration/kerntools path independent of the datapath.
- **Milestone deliverable:** a clean-gated `relocunix` booting on WinUAE with `z3660eth` registered and ENXIO-ing — the kerntools STREAMS path proven end-to-end.

**Phase 2 — Fill the TX seam; first frame on real HW.**
- Implement `z3660ethxmit`: assemble flat frame (correct `u_short` SAP no-swap; pad per Q4/M10), `bcopy` to `txwin`, apply the chosen coherency mechanism (CI-map or `cpushl`-before-trigger), trigger `0x190`, read rc (rc==1 = no-carrier → queue, not error). Implement the chosen Q2 TX flow-control (lock-serialize the single `txwin`, no raised spl across the stall). Read MAC at probe.
- **Loop:** WinUAE compile/boot gate (TX still ENXIOs there) → shuttle to real box. **Real-HW test:** `slink addaen` + `ifconfig zen0 … up -trailers`; send broadcast ARP / crafted frame; observe on the wire.
- **Deliverable:** verified TX of a frame from real HW onto the wire.

**Phase 3 — Fill the RX seam; ARP + ping.**
- Implement `z3660ethintr` + corrected `receive_interrupt` (re-read `0x1A4` per strobe, serial-sentinel break, ack `24`, per-iteration cache invalidate, FCS-correct length, advance `0x194`), reuse `toss_packet_up_stream`. Wire the ISR per Q1.
- **Loop:** WinUAE compile/boot gate → real box. **Real-HW test:** `ping 192.168.2.1` (ARP must complete — Q4 boundary); bidirectional ping; default route.
- **Deliverable:** working ARP + ICMP both directions on real HW @ 192.168.2.39.

**Phase 4 — Coherency soak + hardening.**
- Sustained TX+RX under load with byte-verification (eth analogue of the SCSI `[WVERIFY]` campaign) — the only way to clear Q-COHERENCY, Q3, Q6, Q7. **Prove** the chosen cache mechanism. Resolve Q5 (multicast/promisc + GEM filter mode). Persistent `/etc/inet` config + `zen -S` tool. Tune spl/flow-control.
- **Deliverable:** a stable, persistent, reboot-surviving interface, soak-clean for coherency — ready to commit on `wip-ethernet` off `amix-base`.

**Critical-path note:** Phases 2–4 are **real-HW-gated** (WinUAE has no GEM). Front-load every source-answerable question into Phase 0/1 so real-HW sessions (serial+KVM, no network until this works) are spent purely on the datapath and coherency, not integration mechanics.

## 10. PHASE 0 RESOLUTIONS (2026-06-21 — source-confirmed against the on-disk Amix /usr/sys)

Two top open questions resolved against real kernel source (hydra-amix `/usr/sys` + amix-a4091 `tmp/amix-inc` headers). Both change the plan.

### 10.1 Q-COHERENCY — RESOLVED: per-page CI is impossible; the driver does explicit line-granular 030 cache ops, always.
- The board window (incl. eth windows `0x17ED0000`/`0x17EE0000`) is inside **TT0** (`ttrap.s:326-329`: `tt0=0x003F0143`, covers `0x0–0x3FFFFFFF`, **CI=0 ⇒ CACHEABLE**). On the 030 a **TT match BYPASSES the page tables**, so a PTE CI bit can't override it — and there is **no `PG_CI` bit** in this kernel (`immu.h:66-75` = only PG_M/REF/W/V). ⇒ **sptalloc-ing the eth pages cache-inhibited is IMPOSSIBLE** (the draft's "make it CI in Phase 0" path is dead).
- Stock `aen` does **ZERO** cache maintenance on its shared LANCE RAM (`aen.c:1032,1133,320-386`); coherent only because the 030 **data cache is effectively off** in validated configs (a4091: "data cache off / Amiberry cpu_data_cache=false"). An assumption, not a guarantee — and **unsafe to inherit for ASYNC RX**. `z3660.c` SCSI is **synchronous**, so its no-flush stance is NOT a valid precedent for async RX.
- **DECISION:** the driver issues explicit **68030 LINE-GRANULAR `cpushl dc,(an)`** looped over the frame's 16-byte lines — NOT `cpusha/cinva dc` (whole-cache op would discard unrelated dirty lines = data loss). TX: `cpushl` the TX frame after fill, before the `0x190` trigger. RX: `cpushl`/`cinvl` the slot's lines before reading header/payload. Correct whether DC is on or off → **no dependency on reading CACR**. ⚠️ verify the Amix `as` accepts `cpushl dc,(%a0)` syntax at build; provide as inline asm (kernel ships no cache helper).

### 10.2 Q1 (INT6 servicing) — RESOLVED: AMIX has NO level-6 driver hook → decouple the datapath from it.
- Only **INT2** has a driver table (`int2_tbl[]`, bare fn-pointers, shared-line self-poll; `kernel.c:188`, walked by `ttrap.s:40-49`). **Level 6 (EXTER) is hardwired** to `aciabintr` (CIA-B/clock; `ttrap.s:118-132`, `acia.c:42`) — no table, no hook.
- Firmware raises eth RX as **INT6/EXTER** by default; its INT2 path is gated behind `DEVF_INT2MODE` = a physical **Z3660 board-mod** (`device.c:233-242,309`).
- Three RX-delivery options, **none needing a firmware change**: (a) **polled** drain via STREAMS callout — zero IRQ wiring, ideal for datapath bring-up; (b) **chain** `z3660eth_drain()` into `aciabintr` (one C line, shares EXTER/clock); (c) proper **`int6_tbl`** + `p6int` walk in `ttrap.s` (clean, edits asm). The "cleanest" firmware-INT2-move needs a **hardware board-mod** → user decision, deferred.
- **DECISION:** write RX as a standalone `z3660eth_drain(board)` callable from EITHER a poll-callout or an ISR. Bring the datapath up with **(a) polled RX**; surface (b)/(c)/board-mod for interrupt-driven RX later. **Neither TX (synchronous) nor polled-RX needs the interrupt question solved.**

### 10.3 Knock-on simplifications
- **Firmware-change decision UNCHANGED (none needed)** — AMIX-side poll/chain delivers RX.
- **Phase-1 kernel.c edit = ONE insertion:** cdevsw slot **48** (`&z3660ethinfo`) + its extern, using `aen`'s **LAZY-OPEN** model (no `init_tbl`/`io_init` entry) → gate-safe on the GEM-less WinUAE box. No `int2_tbl`/`int6`/`acia.c` edits until Phase-3 interrupt-driven RX. Free majors confirmed 48,49,51–69 (`kernel.c:398-419`) → **48**.
- **Build anchors:** anchor kerntools edits on `aen*` (stock: cdevsw:357 `&aeninfo`, int2_tbl:193 `aenintr`); the golden box may lack hydra lines (BLOCKER-1) — still pull live `kernel.c` at gate time, but `aen` anchors are safe.
